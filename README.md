# pulsefm
Few changes regarding better interface handling:
1. PLAY button (main page) and station name are different links:
First one plays radio instantly, and second one transports to Venue details.
This enables user to play different stations without going into necessary details.
HOWEVER, in this case, a "play this station" button should be placed on Venue detail page (can be putted next to station name as well) in order to avoid going back to main page for music playing.

2. Added "<" symbol next to Pulse.fm logo on Venue page â€“ makes "back" function more understandable.
