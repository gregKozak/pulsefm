Few changes regarding better interface handling:

1. PLAY button (main page) and station name are different links:
First one plays radio instantly, and second one transports to Venue details.
This enables user to play different stations without going into necessary details.
HOWEVER, in this case, a "play this station" button should be placed on Venue detail page (can be putted next to station name as well) in order to avoid going back to main page for music playing.

2. Added "<" symbol next to Pulse.fm logo on Venue page â€“ makes "back" function more understandable.

Lastly, one problem:

Since fonts used in layout are not licence-free, I cannot use them to convert info font-face. I think we should consider using some fonts from vast library of google fonts. I can find some good replacements.
